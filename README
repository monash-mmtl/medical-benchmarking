# MEDICAL BENCHMARKING

This repository contains a multi-turn medical benchmarking project inspired by ideas and implementations from [CRAFT-MD](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03328-5) and [AgentClinic](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.07960)

We include a series of generated cases for evaluation from differential diagnoses and presenting complaints taken from the Murtagh's General Practice textbook.

## Data generation workflow:
- main_generation.py: First generation run of all_cases.jsonl
