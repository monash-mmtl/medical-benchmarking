# MEDICAL BENCHMARKING

This repository contains a multi-turn medical benchmarking project inspired by ideas and implementations from [CRAFT-MD](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03328-5) and [AgentClinic](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.07960).

We include a series of generated cases for evaluation from differential diagnoses and presenting complaints taken from Murtagh's *General Practice* textbook.

## Data Generation Workflow
- `main_generation.py`: First generation run of `all_cases.jsonl`.
